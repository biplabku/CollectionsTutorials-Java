# Theory and implementation of Java collections  - comparator and comparable
### What are collections ?
1. Collections are frameworks to provide an architecture to order, store and manipulate the data's.
2. Operations may include insertion, deletion, searching, manipulation that one does for the data structure (which includes stack, queues, tree etc).
3. these same operations can be performed by the collections.
4. So instead of creating the source code/ or the basic implementation of all the data structures, we can implements the interfaces of these collections to use the same data structures that one intends to write.
